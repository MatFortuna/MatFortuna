Computer software and hardware has been something I have been dabbling in as a hobby for most of my life. I've always had a passion for building computer games, websites, and networks with my friends. After starting at Tech Elevator I was surprised about how much of coding I forgot I knew and how much nostalgia was tied to this.
I am excited everyday to get to be learning and growing in this world with so many other people who share a language and culture with me that I did have in my past careers.  

Before transitioning to tech life I was working in Retail Food Management. What started as a "temporary" job while I got my freelance graphic design gig to pick up turned into an eleven year, multi-state run with Whole Foods Market. I started as a cashier in Philadelphia, PA, moved to Front End Associate Team Leader, and then Seafood ATL in North Wales, PA. From there I moved on to a Grocery ATL in Portland, ME, and then Seafood Team Leader in Vienna, VA and Atlanta, GA. I made one last move to Associate Store Team Leader in Pittsburgh, PA. It was quite a journey where I made tons of new friends and learned everything about managing a high end fast paced food retail business. No matter how many new stores or promotions, I just knew I wanted to be doing something else.
